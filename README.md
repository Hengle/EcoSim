# EcoSim

I begun this project with the intention of becoming familiar with [Unity](https://unity.com/), as well as to dip my toes into simulations.

This was all inspired and made possible by:

- [Sebastian Lague's "Procedural Terrain Generation" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3)  
- [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com)  
- [Voronoi Map Generator](https://github.com/SteveJohnstone/VoronoiMapGen)  
- ["Primer" videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ/videos)
